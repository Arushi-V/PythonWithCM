# Random Number
"""
-> Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, 
-> but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
"""
# before using random we need to imprt it because its a modul
import random # it is recommended to put imports on top of file/module

x = random.randrange(1, 7) # first param is included and second is excluded
print(x)
